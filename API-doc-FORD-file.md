[TOC]

@warning This API documentation for the Fortran-lang/stdlib is a work in progress

Fortran stdlib API Documentation
================================

This is the main API documentation landing page generated by [FORD].
The documentation for comment markup in source code, running [FORD] and the [FORD project file] are all maintained on the [FORD wiki].

Goals and Motivation
====================

The Fortran Standard, as published by the ISO (https://wg5-fortran.org/), does
not have a Standard Library. The goal of this project is to provide a community
driven and agreed upon *de facto* "standard" library for Fortran, called a
Fortran Standard Library (`stdlib`). We have a rigorous process how `stdlib` is
developed as documented in our [Workflow](page/contributing/Workflow.html). `stdlib` is both a
specification and a reference implementation. We are cooperating with the
Fortran Standards Committee (e.g., the effort
[started](https://github.com/j3-fortran/fortran_proposals/issues/104) at the J3
committee repository) and the plan is to continue working with the Committee in
the future (such as in the step 5. in the [Workflow](page/contributing/Workflow.html) document), so
that if the Committee wants to standardize some feature already available in `stdlib`, it would
base it on `stdlib`'s implementation.

Scope
=====

The goal of the Fortran Standard Library is to achieve the following general scope:

* Utilities (containers, strings, files, OS/environment integration, unit
  testing & assertions, logging,  ...)
* Algorithms (searching and sorting, merging, ...)
* Mathematics (linear algebra, sparse matrices, special functions, fast Fourier
  transform, random numbers, statistics, ordinary differential equations,
  numerical integration, optimization, ...)

Code of Conduct
===============

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. Please read first [this Code of Conduct](./page/contributing/CodeOfConduct.html)

License
=======

The `stdlib` source code and related files and documentation are distributed under the [MIT license](page/License.html).
