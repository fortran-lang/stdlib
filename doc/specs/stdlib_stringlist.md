# Lists of strings

[TOC]

## Introduction

Fortran has supported variable-length strings since the 2003 standard,
but it does not have a native type to handle collections of strings of
different lengths. Such collections are quite useful though and the
language allows us to define a derived type that can handle such
collections.

The `stdlib_stringlist` module defines a derived type that is capable of
storing a list of strings and of manipulating them.

Methods include:

* inserting strings at a given position
* replacing strings at a given position
* deleting a single string or a range of strings
* retrieving a string or a range of strings at a given position
* finding the position of a particular string or a string which contains some substring
* sorting the list

## Positions in a list of strings

The module implements what are effectively infinitely long lists: a position is
represented as a positive integer, but there is no "out-of-bound" index. That is,
the following piece of code will simply work:

```fortran
type(stringlist_type) :: list

! Add two strings ...
call list%insert( list_head, "The first string" )
call list%insert( 20, "The last string" )

write(*,*) 'The last:    ', list%get(list_end)
write(*,*) 'Beyond that: ', list%get(30)
```
The special position `list_head` represents *the first element*, though a value
of 1 is equivalent. Likewise, the special position `list_end` represents the position
of the *last* element and the position `list_after_end` the position directly after
the last element. You can use these positions to insert a string before the current
first string that is already in the list or to insert after the last string that
has been inserted.

If you specify a position beyond the last, the `list%get()` method simply returns an empty
string. The same holds for *zero* or *negative* indices.

For inserting one or more elements, a *zero* or *negative* index is interpreted to mean the first,
an index beyond the last as the one *after* the last - this means effectively that the element is appended.

If you do:

```fortran
call list%insert(   1, 'The first string' )
call list%insert( -10, 'A new first string' )
```

the second inserted string will become the string at the *first* position (1) and all other strings
are shifted by one:

```none
element 1: 'A new first string'
element 2: 'The first string'
element 3: ...
```

If you need the last but one string, you can do so in this way:

```fortran
write(*,*) 'The last but one: ', list%get(list_end-1)
```

So, it is possible to do simple arithmetic.


## The derived type: stringlist_type

### Status

Experimental

### Description

The type holds a small number of components and gives access to a number of procedures,
some of which are implemented as subroutines, others as functions or as operations.

## Details of the methods

### `delete` - delete one or more strings

#### Status

Experimental

#### Description

Delete one or more strings from the list via a given position or positions.

#### Syntax

`call list % [[stringlist_type(type):delete(bound)]]( first [, last] )`

#### Class

Subroutine

#### Arguments

`list`: the stringlist variable from which to delete one or more strings

`first`: the index of the first string to be deleted

`last` (optional): the index of the last string to be deleted. If left out, only one string is deleted.
If the value is lower than that of `first`, the range is considered to be empty and nothing is deleted.


### `destroy` - destroy all strings in the list

#### Status

Experimental

#### Description

Destroy the entire contents of the list. As the variable holding the list is simply a derived type, the variable
itself is not destroyed.

#### Syntax

`call list % [[stringlist_type(type):destroy(bound)]]`

#### Class

Subroutine

#### Arguments

`list`: the stringlist variable from which to delete all strings


### `get` - get a single string from the list

#### Status

Experimental

#### Description

Get the string at the given position.

#### Syntax

`string = list % [[stringlist_type(type):get(bound) ( idx )]]`

#### Class

Function

#### Arguments

`list`: the stringlist variable to retrieve a string from

`idx`: the index of the string to be retrieved (see [`the section on positions`](./stdlib_stringlist.html#position-in-a-list-of-strings)

#### Result value

A copy of the string stored at the indicated position.


### `index` - find the index of a particular string in the list

#### Status

Experimental

#### Description

Get the position of the first stored string that matches the given string, if `back` is not present or false. If `back` is
false, return the position of the last stored string that matches. Note that trailing blanks are ignored.

#### Syntax

`idx = list % [[stringlist_type(type):index(bound) ( string, back )]]`

#### Class

Function

#### Arguments

`list`: the stringlist variable to retrieve a string from

`string`: the string to be found in the list

`back` (optional): logical argument indicating the first occurrence should be returned (`false`) or the last (`true`)

#### Result value

The result is either the index of the string in the list or -1 if the string was not found

#### Example

Because trailing blanks are ignored, the following calls will give the same result:

```fortran
    write(*,*) list%index( 'A' )
    write(*,*) list%index( 'A    ' )
```


### `index_sub` - find the index of a string containing the given substring in the list

#### Status

Experimental

#### Description

Get the position of the first stored string that contains the given substring, if `back` is not present or false. If `back` is
false, return the position of the last stored string that contains it.

#### Syntax

`idx = list % [[stringlist_type(type):index_sub(bound) ( substring, back )]]`

#### Class

Function

#### Arguments

`list`: the stringlist variable to retrieve a string from

`substring`: the substring in question

`back` (optional): logical argument indicating the first occurrence should be returned (`false`) or the last (`true`)

#### Result value

The result is either the index of the string in the list or -1 if the string was not found


### `insert` - insert one or more strings after a given position

#### Status

Experimental

#### Description

Insert one or more strings at a given position. The position may be anything as explained in the section on positions.
A single string may be inserted, another list of strings or a plain array of strings. In all cases trailing blanks, if any,
are retained.

#### Class

Subroutine

#### Arguments

`list`: the stringlist variable to insert the string(s) into

`idx`: the position after which the strings should be inserted

`string`: the string to be inserted, a list of strings or a plain array of strings


### `length` - return the length of the list

#### Status

Experimental

#### Description

Return the length of the list, defined as the highest index for which a string has been assigned. You can place strings
in any position without needing to fill in the intervening positions.

#### Syntax

`length = list % [[stringlist_type(type):length(bound) ()]]`

#### Class

Function

#### Arguments

`list`: the stringlist variable to retrieve the length from

#### Result value

Returns the highest index of a string that has been set.



### `range` - retrieve a range of strings from the list

#### Status

Experimental

#### Description

#### Result value

The result is a new list containing all the strings that appear from the first to the last position, inclusively.



### `replace` - replace one or more strings between two given positions

#### Status

Experimental

#### Description

Replace one or more strings between two given positions. The new strings may be given as a single string, a list of
strings or a plain array.

#### Class

Subroutine

#### Arguments

`list`: the stringlist variable to replace the string(s) in


`first`: the position of the first string to be retrieved

`last`: the position of the last string to be retrieved. If only one string needs to be replaced by another string,
then this argument can be left out.

`string`: the string to be inserted, a list of strings or a plain array of strings



### `sort` - return a sorted list

#### Status

Experimental

#### Description

Create a new list consisting of the sorted strings of the given list. The strings are sorted according to ASCII, either
in ascending order or descending order.

#### Syntax

`sortedlist = list % [[stringlist_type(type):sort(bound) ( ascending )]]`

#### Class

Subroutine

#### Arguments

`list`: the stringlist variable of which the contents should be copied

`ascending` (optional): if not present or true, sort the list in ascending order, otherwise descending

#### Result value
