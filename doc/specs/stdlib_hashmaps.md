## Overview of hash maps

A hash map (hash table) is a data structure that maps *keys* to
*values*. It uses a hash function to compute a hash code from the *key*
that serves as an index into a linear array of *slots* (buckets) from
which the desired *value* can be extracted.
Each key ideally maps to a unique slot, but most hash functions are
imperfect and can map multiple keys to the same *slot* resulting in
collisions. Hash maps differ in how they deal with such collisions.
This document discusses the hash maps in the Fortran Standard Library.

## Licensing

The Fortran Standard Library is distributed under the MIT License.
However components of the library should be evaluated as to whether
they are compatible with the MIT License.
The current hash maps were inspired by an
[implementation](http://chasewoerner.org/src/hasht/) of David
Chase. While the code has been greatly modified from his
implementation, he has give permission for the unrestricted use of
his code.

## The hash map modules

The Fortran Standard Library provides two modules for the
implementation of simple hash maps. These maps only accept hash
functions with a single argument, the key, and yield a 32 bit
hash code. The modules will need to be modified if it is desired to
use hash functions with a different API. The two modules are:
`stdlib_hashmap_wrappers`, and `stdlib_hashmaps` corresponding to the
files: `stdlib_hashmap_wrappers.f90`, and `stdlib_hashmaps.f90`

The module `stdlib_hashmap_wrappers` provides types and procedures for
use by `stdlib_hashmaps`. It provides an
interface to the 32 bit hash functions of the Standard Library module,
`stdlib_hash_32bit`, and provides wrappers to some of the
hash functions so that they no longer need to be supplied seeds. It
also defines two data types used to store information in the hash
maps, the `key_type` and the `other_type`. The `key_type` is used to
define keys that, in turn, are used to identify the data entered into
a hash map. The `other_type` is intended to contain the other data
associated with the key.

The module `stdlib_hashmaps` defines the API for a parent datatype,
`hashmap_type` and two extensions of that hash map type:
`chaining_hashmap_type` and `open_hashmap_type`.

The `hashmap_type` defines the Application Programmers
Interface (API) for the procedures used by its two extensions. It
explicitly defines five non-overridable procedures. It also defines
the interfaces for eleven deferred procedures. It does not define the
finalization routines for the two extension types, or one routine
provided by the `open_hashmap_type`.

The `chaining_hashmap_type` uses separate chaining with linked
lists to deal with hash index collisions. In separate chaining the
colliding indices are handled by using linked lists with their roots
at the hash index. The `chaining_hashmap_type` procedures are
implemented in the module `stdlib_hashmap_chaining` corresponding
to the file, `stdlib_hashmap_chaining.f90`.

The `open_hashmap_type`
uses linear open addressing to deal with hash index collisions. In
linear open addressing the colliding indices are
handled by searching from the initial hash index in increasing
steps of one (modulo the hash map size) for an open map slot.
The `open_hashmap_type` procedures are implemented in the submodule
`stdlib_hashmap_open` corresponding to the file
`stdlib_hashmap_open.f90`.

The maps use powers of two for their slot sizes, so that the function,
`fibonacci_hash`, can 
be used to map the hash codes to indices in the map. This is
expected to be more efficient than prime number mapping using a
modulo operation, and reduces the requirement that the hash
function need to do a good job randomizing its lower order bits.
They do require a good randomizing hash method for good performance.
Both adjust the map size to reduce collisions, based on 
the ratio of the number of hash map probes to the number of subroutine 
calls.
Wile the maps make extensive use of pointers internally, a private
finalization subroutine avoids memory leaks.
The maps can take entry keys of type `key_type`, and other data of the
type `other_type`.
The maps allow the addition, removal, and lookup of entries, and the
inclusion of data in addition to the entry key.

## The `stdlib_hashmap_wrappers` module

The `stdlib_hashmap_wrappers` module provides data types to
represent keys and associated data stored in a module, but is also, a
wrapper for the `stdlib_hash_32bit` module. It allows
direct access to the `stdlib_hash_32bit` procedures:
`fibonacci_hash`, `fnv_1_hasher`, `fnv_1a_hasher`; and provides
wrapper functions, `seeded_nmhash32_hasher`,
`seeded_nmhash32x_hasher`, and `seeded_water_hasher` to the hash
functions: `nmhash32`, `nmhash32x`, and `water_hash`, respectively. It
defines an interface, `hasher_fun`, compatible with the hash functions
that take a `non-scalar key`. It defines one integer constant used
as a kind value,`int_hash`. It also defines two types, `key_type` and
`other_type`, and associated procedures, for storing and manipulating
keys and their associated data.

### The `stdlib_hashmap_wrappers`'s constant, `int_hash`

The constant `int_hash` is used to define the integer kind value for
the returned hash codes and variables used to access them. It
currently is imported from `stdlib_hash_32bit` where it has the
value, `int32`. 

### The `stdlib_hashmap_wrappers`' module's derived types

The `stdlib_hashmap_wrappers` module defines two derived types:
`key_type`, and `other_type`. The `key_type` is intended to be used
for the search keys of hash tables.  The `other_type` is intended to
store additional data associated with a key. Both types are
opaque. Their current representations are as follows

```fortran
    type :: key_type
        private
        integer(int8), allocatable :: value(:)
    end type key_type

    type :: other_type
        private
        class(*), allocatable :: value
    end type other_type
```

The module also defines six procedures for those types: `copy_key`,
`copy_other`, `equal_keys`, `free_key`, `free_other`, `get`, and
`set`, and one operator, `==`,
for use by the hash maps to manipulate or inquire of components of
those types.

### Table of `stdlib_hashmap_wrappers` procedures

The  `stdlib_hashmap_wrappers` module provides procedures in
several categories: procedures to manipulate data of the `key_type`;
procedures to manipulate data of the `other_type`, and 32 bit hash
functions for keys. The procedures in each category are listed
below. It also provides an operator to compare two key type values for
equality. 

Procedures to manipulate `key_type` data:

* `copy_key( key_in, key_out )` - Copies the contents of the key,
  `key_in`, to contents of the key, `key_out`.

* `get( key, value )` - extracts the contents of `key` into `value`,
  an `int8` array or character string.

* `free_key( key )` - frees the memory in `key`.

* `set( key, value )` - sets the content of `key` to `value`.

Procedures to manipulate `other_type` data:

* `copy_other( other_in, other_out )` - Copies the contents of the
  other data, `other_in`, to the contents of the other data,
  `other_out`.

* `get( other, value )` - extracts the contents of `other` into the
  `class(*)` variable `value`.

* `set( other, value )` - sets the content of `other` to the `class(*)`
  variable `value`. 

* `free_other( other )` - frees the memory in `other`.

Procedures to hash keys to 32 bit integers:

* `fnv_1_hasher( key )` - hashes a `key` using the FNV-1 algorithm.

* `fnv_1a_hasher( key )` - hashes a `key` using the FNV-1a algorithm.

* `seeded_nmhash32_hasher( key )` - hashes a `key` using the nmhash32
  algorithm.

* `seeded_nmhash32x_hasher( key )` - hashes a `key` using the nmhash32x
  algorithm.

* `seeded_water_hasher( key )` - hashes a `key` using the waterhash
  algorithm.

Operator to compare two `key_type` values for equality

* `key1 == key2` - compares `key1` with `key2` for equality

## The `stdlib_hashmaps` module

The `stdlib_hashmaps` module defines three public data types,
associated procedures and constants that implement two simple hash map
types using separate chaining hashing and open addressing hashing. The
derived type `hashmap_type` is the parent type to its two
extensions: `chaining_hashmap_type` and `open_hashmap_type`.
The extension types provide 
procedures to manipulate the structure of a hash map object:
`init`, `map_entry`, `rehash`, `remove`, and
`set_other_data`. They also provide procedures to inquire about
entries in the hash map: `get_other_data`, and
`key_test`. Finally they provide procedures to inquire about the
overall structure and performance of the hash map object:`calls`,
`entries`, `get_other_data`, `loading`, `slots`, and
`total_depth`. The module also defines a number of public constants:
`probe_factor`, `load_factor`, `map_probe_factor`, `default_bits`,
`max_bits`, `int_calls`, `int_depth`, `int_index`,
`int_probes`, `success`, `alloc_fault`, and `array_size_error`.

### The `stdlib_hashmaps` module's public constants

The module defines several categories of public constants. Some are
used to parameterize the empirical slot expansion code. Others
parameterize the slots table size. Some are used to define
integer kind values for different applications. Finally, some are used
to report errors or success.

The constants `probe_factor`, and `map_probe_factor` are used to
parameterize the slot expansion code used to determine when in a
in a procedure call the number 
of slots need to be increased to decrease the search path for an
entry. The constant `probe_factor` is used to determine when
the ratio of the number of map probes to map calls is too large and 
the slots need expansion. The constant `map_probe_factor` is used to
determine when inserting a new entry the ratio of the number of map
probes to map calls is too large and the slots need expansion.

The constants `default_bits`, and
`max_bits` are used to parameterize the table's slots size. The
`default_bits` constant defines the default initial number of slots
with a current value of 6 resulting in an initial `2**6 == 64`
slots. This may optionally be overridden on hash map creation. The
`max_bits` parameter sets the maximum table size as `2**max_bits` with
a default value for `max_bits` of 30. The table will not work for a
slots size greater than `2**30`.

The constants `int_calls`, `int_depth`, `int_index`, and `int_probes`
are used to define integer kind values for various contexts. The
number of calls are reported and stored in entities of kind
`int_calls`. Currently `int_calls` has the value of `int64`. The
total depth, the number of inquiries needed to access all elements
of the table, is reported and stored in entities of kind
`int_depth`. Currently `int_depth` has the value of `int64`. The
number of entries in the table, is reported and stored in entities of
kind `int_index`. Currently `int_index` has the value of `int32`.
The number of probes, hash map enquiries, are reported and stored in
entities of kind `int_probes`. Currently `int_probes` has the value of
`int64`.

The constant `load_factor` is only used by the `open_hashmap_type`. It
specifies the maximum fraction of the available slots that may be
filled before expansion occurs. The current `load_factor = 0.5625` so
the current implementation of `open_hashmap_type` can only hold a
little more than `2**29` entries.

Finally the error codes `success`, `alloc_fault`, and
`array_size_error` are used to report the error status of certain
procedure calls. The `succes` code indicates that no problems were
found. The `alloc_fault` code indicates that a memory allocation
failed. Finally the `array_size_error` indicates that on table
creation `slots_bits` is less than `default_bits` or
greater than `max_bits`.

### The `stdlib_hashmaps` module's derived types

The `stdlib_hashmaps` module defines three public derived types and
seven private types used in the implementation of the public
types. The public types are the abstract `hashmap_type` and its
extensions: `chaining_hashmap_type` and `open_hashmap_type`. The three
private derived types, `chaining_map_entry_type`,
`chaining_map_entry_ptr`, and `chaining_map_entry_pool` are used in
the implementation of the `chaining_hashmap_type` public type. The
four private derived types, `open_map_entry_type`,
`open_map_entry_list`, `open_map_entry_ptr`, and `open_map_entry_pool`
are used in the implementation of the `open_hashmap_type` public
type. Each of these types are described below. 

#### The `hashmap_type` abstract type

The `hashmap_type` abstract type serves as the parent type for the two
types `chaining_hashmap_type` and `open_hashmap_type`. It defines
seven private components:

* `call_count` - the number of procedure calls on the map;

* `nbits` - the number of bits used to address the slots; 

* `num_entries` - the number of entries in the map;

* `num_free` - the number of entries in the free list of removed 
  entries;

* `probe_count` - the number of map probes since the last resizing or
  initialization;

* `total_probes` - the number of probes of the map up to the last
  resizing or initialization; and

* `hasher` - a pointer to the hash function used by the map.

It also defines five non-overridable procedures:

* `calls` - returns the number of procedure calls on the map;

* `entries` - returns the number of entries in the map;

* `map_probes` - returns the number of map probes since
  initialization;

* `num_slots` - returns the number of slots in the map; and

* `slots_bits` - returns the number of bits used to address the slots;
and eleven deferred procedures:

* `get_other_data` - gets the other map data associated with the key;

* `init` - initializes the hash map;

* `key_test` - returns a logical flag indicating whether the key is 
  defined in the map. 

* `loading` - returns the ratio of the number of entries to the number
  of slots;

* `map_entry` - inserts a key and its other associated data into the
  map;

* `rehash` - rehashes the map with the provided hash function;

* `remove` - removes the entry associated wit the key;

* `set_other_data` - replaces the other data associated with the key;

* `total_depth` - returns the number of probes needed to address all
  the entries in the map;

The type's definition is below:

#### The `chaining_map_entry_type` derived type

Entities of the type `chaining_map_entry_type` are used to define
a linked list structure that stores the
key, its other data, the hash of the key, and the resulting index into
the inverse table. The type's definition is below:

```fortran
    type :: chaining_map_entry_type  ! Chaining hash map entry type
        private
        integer(int_hash)   :: hash_val ! Full hash value
        type(key_type)      :: key ! The entry's key
        type(other_type)    :: other ! Other entry data
        integer(int_index)  :: index ! Index into inverse table
        type(chaining_map_entry_type), pointer :: &
            next => null() ! Next bucket
    end type chaining_map_entry_type
```
Currently the `int_hash` and `int_index` have the value of `int32`.

#### The `chaining_map_entry_ptr` derived type

The type `chaining_map_entry_ptr` is used to define the elements of
the hash map that are either empty or link to the linked lists
containing the elements of the table. The type's definition is below:

                                ! map entry type object
        type(chaining_map_entry_type), pointer :: target => null()
    end type chaining_map_entry_ptr
```

    ! Type implementing a pool of allocated
    ! `chaining_map_entry_type` objects
        private
    ! Index of next bucket

    end type chaining_map_entry_pool
```


#### The `chaining_hashmap_type` derived type

The `chaining_hashmap_type` derived type extends the `hashmap_type` to
implements a separate chaining hash map. In addition to the components
of the `hashmap_type` it provides the four components:

* `cache` - a pool of `chaining_map_entry_pool` objects used to reduce
allocation costs;

* `free_list` - a free list of map entries;

* `inverse` - an array of `chaining_map_entry_ptr` bucket lists
(inverses) storing entries at fixed locations once
entered; and

* `slots` - an array of bucket lists serving as the hash map.

It also implements all of the deferred procedures of the
`hashmap_type` and a finalizer for its maps. The type's definition is
as follows:

```fortran
    type, extends(hashmap_type) :: chaining_hashmap_type
        private
        type(chaining_map_entry_pool), pointer    :: cache => null()

    end type chaining_hashmap_type
```

#### The `open_map_entry_type` derived type

Entities of the type `open_map_entry_type` are used to define
a linked list structure that stores the

        private
        integer(int_hash)  :: hash_val ! Full hash value

        type(other_type)   :: other ! Other entry data
        integer(int_index) :: index ! Index into inverse table
    end type open_map_entry_type
```

Currently `int_hash` and `int_index` have the value of `int32`.

#### The `open_map_entry_ptr` derived type

The type `open_map_entry_ptr` is used to define the elements of
the hash map that are either empty or link to the linked lists
containing the elements of the table. The type's definition is below:

```fortran
    type open_map_entry_ptr ! Wrapper for a pointer to a open
                            ! map entry type object
        type(open_map_entry_type), pointer :: target => null()
    end type open_map_entry_ptr
```

#### The `open_hashmap_type` derived type

The `open_hashmap_type` derived type extends the `hashmap_type` to
implement an open addressing hash map. In addition to the components
of the `hashmap_type` it provides the four components:

* `cache` - a pool of `open_map_entry_pool` objects used to reduce
allocation costs;

* `free_list` - a free list of map entries;

* `index_mask` - an `and` mask used in linear addressing;

* `inverse` - an array of `open_map_entry_ptr` bucket lists
(inverses) storing entries at fixed locations once
entered; and

* `slots` - an array of bucket lists serving as the hash map.

It also implements all of the deferred procedures of the
`hashmap_type` and a finalizer for its maps. The type's definition is
as follows:

```fortran
    type, extends(hashmap_type) :: open_hashmap_type 
        private 
        integer(int_index) :: index_mask = 2_int_index**default_bits-1
        type(open_map_entry_pool), pointer    :: cache => null()

        final     :: free_open_map
    end type open_hashmap_type
```
