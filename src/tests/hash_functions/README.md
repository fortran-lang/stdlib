The hash_functions directory contains code to validate the Fortran hash functions against the original C/C++ codes. It consists of one executable `test_hash_functions` that:

* creates a file containing 2048 random 8 bit integers using the subroutine
  `generate_key_array`.

* reads the file generated by the subroutine `generate_key_array` and uses its contents to generate 2049 hashes for each C/C++ hash algorithm and outputs files containing the hashes.

* reads the file generated by the subroutine `generate_key_array` and uses its contents to generate 2049 hashes for each Fortran hash algorithm and compares the result with the corresponding outputs of C/C++ hash algorithms.
