# The `validation` subdirectory

This directory contains source code and a makefile, `Makefile.validation`,
for generatng applications from the souce code intended to test the more
complicated hash functions in `libstdlib.a` aginst the original C and C++
hash procedures. At least two of the hash procedures, nmhash32 anc
nmhash32x assumes that the C processor is either gcc or MSVC so that
currently the tests can only use gcc.

The makefile generates three applications\:
`generate_key_array`, `generate_hash_arrays`, and `hash_validity_test`.
* `generate_key_array` generates a file, `key_array.bin`, that contains a
random sequence of 2048 eight bit integers.
* `generate_hash_arrays` generates five files, `c_nmhash32_array.bin`, `c_nmhash32x_array.bin`, `c_pengy_hash_array.bin`, `c_spooky_hash_array.bin`,
and `c_water_hash_array.bin`, that, in turn, represent the results of applying
the corresponding C/C++ hash functions on subsequences of the data in
`key_array.bin`.
* `hash_validity_test` compares the contents of the files generated by
`generate_hash_arrays` against the results of applying the corresponding
Fortran based hash functions in `libstdlib.a` on the same subsequences
of `key_array.bin`, and reports whether the comparisons match.

The applications sshould be run in the sequence: first, `generate_key_array`,
then `generate_hash_arrays`, and finally `hash_validity_test`.
