! The Rust version in turn is a simplification of the Timsort algorithm
! described in
! https://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Objects/listsort.txt, as
! it drops both the use of 'galloping' to identify bounds of regions to be
! sorted and the estimation of the optimal `run size`. However it remains
! a hybrid sorting algorithm combining an iterative Merge sort controlled
! by a stack of `RUNS` identified by regions of uniformly decreasing or
! non-decreasing sequences that may be expanded to a minimum run size and
! initially processed by an insertion sort.
!
! Note the Fortran implementation simplifies the logic as it only has to
! deal with Fortran arrays of intrinsic types and not the full generality
! of Rust's arrays and lists for arbitrary types. It also adds the
! estimation of the optimal `run size` as suggested in Tim Peters'
! original `listsort.txt`, and an optional `work` array to be used as
! scratch memory.

! using an insertion sort. The merge process is driven by a stack of

! are satisfied:
!
! 1. for every `i` in `1..size(runs)-1`: `runs(i - 1)%len > runs(i)%len`
! 2. for every `i` in `2..size(runs)-1`: `runs(i - 2)%len >
!    runs(i - 1)%len + runs(i)%len`

! A translation to Fortran 2008, of the `"Rust" sort` algorithm found in

! The Rust version in turn is a simplification of the Timsort algorithm
! described in
! https://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Objects/listsort.txt, as
! it drops both the use of 'galloping' to identify bounds of regions to be
! sorted and the estimation of the optimal `run size`. However it remains
! a hybrid sorting algorithm combining an iterative Merge sort controlled
! by a stack of `RUNS` identified by regions of uniformly decreasing or
! non-decreasing sequences that may be expanded to a minimum run size and
! initially processed by an insertion sort.
!
! Note the Fortran implementation simplifies the logic as it only has to
! deal with Fortran arrays of intrinsic types and not the full generality
! of Rust's arrays and lists for arbitrary types. It also adds the
! estimation of the optimal `run size` as suggested in Tim Peters'
! original `listsort.txt`, and an optional `work` array to be used as
! scratch memory.

! 2. for every `i` in `2..size(runs)-1`: `runs(i - 2)%len >
!    runs(i - 1)%len + runs(i)%len`
